## About This Program

I made a website that takes in information from weatherapi.com. It takes a zip code or city name, and inserts that value into the url of the AJAX call. The AJAX call returns a string of data, and I entered that data into the HTML using JQuery. The website can take any zipcode from USA, Canada, or United Kingdom and return weather results for that day and the next 3 days.
